          <div class="brief">
            <p>
              Anytime Africa is mentioned, stories of famine, wars, diseases and
               poverty are very much related to it. These are some reasons why
               problems facing Africa, must be given urgent responses. Governments
                have put in place a number of structural adjustment programmes to
                 curb the problems in the past. Unfortunately, these programmes
                 have not changed the ordeals of Africa significantly.
                 This submission places a high premium on prayer as one of the
                 surest ways of providing the right kind of response to the
                 problems of Africa. This is in no way suggesting that Africa's
                 problems are solely spiritual. It is true that some of Africa's
                 problems do centre on social injustices, corruptions, bad governance,
                economic mismanagement and political instability. These factors
                stated above, require some pragmatic measures to tackle, yet
                resorting to prayer combined with well-focused social interventions
                can be a step in the right direction in dealing with issues confronting Africa.  <br><br>

              Africa by all standards cannot be referred to as a dark nor doomed
              continent; but rather, it is a rising continent which holds the key
              to the future of the world’s economy. Regardless of what we see and
              hear, it is believed that Africa shall one day arise, shine and
              occupy her place on the world economic map. When people genuinely
              pray, calling on God to intervene on matters affecting nations,
              it is believed that their situation shall surely change.
              (Jeremiah 32:27 (NIV), “I am the Lord, the God of all mankind.
              Is anything too hard for me?”) For instance, it has been noted
              that “the role of religion has been particularly significant in
              the development of Namibia, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. The churches
              in Ethiopia and Senegal have also promoted the development of
              their societies in many ways.” (Kessey, 2009) <br><br>

              From the above context, it can be inferred that all issues of life
               require some amount of prayer to deal with; whether economic or
               political. For this reason, the need for a place where prayer
               will go on around the clock together with some direct efforts
               of providing social relief services and health care in the heart
               of Africa is long overdue. The ideals that precipitated the
               concept of “Elevation City” were simply based on finding a place
                that can provide a serene and conducive environment away from home.
                The primary preoccupations of the Elevation City are prayer,
                reformation of the youth and the aged. These, in very clear
                terms must be considered as priority areas of concentration
                within the context of the Kingdom of God. <br><br>

              It is on purpose that the centre's name has been coined as “Elevation City”.
              This is intended to make the city stand out different and also unique
              from all other places that may bear a similar name. The name has been
              composed as two distinct words, 'Elevation’ and ‘City'. This expression
              in its right context defines the scope of operations and also addresses
              completely the centre's mission statement. To capture in full what the
              centre stands for without any ambiguities, and to affirm its uniqueness,
              the centre is named and known as Elevation City. A place where spiritual
              illumination through prayer brings full transformation in the lives of
              people. Here, transformation is materialised when help and breakthroughs
              are felt by the people in terms of being corporately and socially
              responsible towards everybody in the reach of the centre. <br><br>

             Therefore, the centre is proposed to be described as a fiscal
             non-profitable organization established just to give support to people.
             It is with this view that the running of the centre is planned to be
             voluntarily resourced. In addition, the beneficiaries will be limitless
             and not just only those who would patronize the centre but also the
             communities far and near. <br><br>

             In addition to the following, the Elevation City will be one of the
             greatest investments in the lives of people in the neighbourhood of
              Yamoransa and the world as a whole. The various developmental
              structures that may be put up may serve as a sustained income for
              the families of artisans who will find work there. This will in
              itself go a long way in improving the lots of people in the area
              directly and indirectly. <br><br>
